Project Name: foodMap

Purpose: To have a platform where you can save and share your favorite food places with family.

Audience: People who travel and love food. 

Narrative: A mix between Yelp and Instagram, foodMap, an application for people who love food. We live in a world full of restaurants that come from many cultures, but we still struggle with finding a place to eat. With foodMap you have the ability to save your favorite restaurants and see how much of the world you have ventured into. You can also share your history with others like friends and family. It will make it easier to come together and find new and amazing food discoveries.
